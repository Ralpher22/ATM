# ATM
C++ code for an ATM that allows users to withdraw cash, check their balance, and perform other basic transactions

This code defines an ATM class that has four public methods: CheckBalance, WithdrawCash,
DepositCash, and a constructor that initializes the balance of the ATM. The main function then
creates an instance of the ATM class and enters a loop that prompts the user for a transaction.
Depending on the input, the ATM will perform the corresponding action and output the result to
the console.
